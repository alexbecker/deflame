Deflame
=======

### What it is:

Deflame is a Chrome extension intended to improve discourse on WordPress blogs 
by allowing users to share their perception of the argument with others. 

### What it does:

When a supported site is detected, the Deflame icon will appear in the address bar.
Click to get agree/disagree/ignore on each comment, which indicate how you feel about
the *author* of the comment. Click again to remove all "ignored" comments and add
a table of who you (dis)agree with at the top of the page. This comes with a short link
to a version hosted at _defla.me_ so you can show other commenters how you see the conversation.

### Why:

The biggest problem with online debates is that each side gets their impression from the
inevitable chunk of loud asshats or outright trolls on the other side. Now not only can
you inform others of what you consider "your side", you can inform them of what you consider
theirs as well--which you might well have gotten wrong, and now they can tell you.

### Non-Chrome Alternatives:

You can copy and past the post url to _defla.me/deflame.php?url=[insert url]_, 
but the user experience is inferior.

### Known issues:

Many. The web is a nonstandard nightmare, and recognizing what is and isn't a comment is
probably AI-complete. The extension has a heuristic for guessing that works in most cases,
but it will never be perfect. The placement of buttons is also variable and sometimes sub-optimal, 
because the format of comments is inconsistent. Some sites for which the icon appears are
probably unsupported. This is probably unfixable, but it's due to how Chrome extensions work
rather than the websites themselves.
